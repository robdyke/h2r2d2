This competition made it difficult for people to distinguish NHS services and communications from those of commercial companies or charities. The single NHS identity was created to address these issues of identity and to improve recognition and accountability.

We are a group of clinicians, developers, health informaticians and others who believe that lightweight healthcare apps for patients, carers and health and care professionals provide the key to enabling IT to transform of health and care.
We believe that the app paradigm (which enables rapid development and deployment) is applicable on all devices and is not just about mobile.
We want to encourage and support app developers. We know from our own experience that creating an app and getting it widely used can be a painful experience and have decided to establish HANDI as a new organisation to provide mutual support for developers of health and care apps and others interested in this area and want to invite you to join us.

I also found a PDF guide written by Cisco to getting the Shrew Soft client to talk to a Cisco SA 500. There is another technote on configuring the SA500 to accept the connections from a Shrew Soft client too, which is quite helpful.
Read on for the recipe.

Rather than write anything more (that you won’t read) about dotgotlabs, here is a video produced to explain the project … including me and others with great faces for radio.
With interests in open source, open standards and interoperability and with experience in and around the NHS, I’ve contributed to many solutions posted in the Healthcare challenge. I’ve commented on the interoperability challenges facing ‘Solutions’ such as ‘Give Patients Access to Data’ (a challenge involving Patient Opinion and MyDex, see previous post on Brent Council opening up resident data access) and on the use of social media in healthcare solutions … and the privacy implications there in….
I’ve been contributing heavily to a solution posted by Tim Knight which proposed greater use of open source practices in the NHS - provisionally titled Open Me Project (login req; email me for invitation).
The goal of the solution is to provide a framework and supporting tools for the collaborative development of open source solutions for NHS organisations and commercial healthcare providers. The solution has been voted up to progress from ‘Buzz’ stage to ‘Teaming’ stage.
As part of the incubation process for solutions, DotGovLabs have engaged the support of Experts from Departments of state and the Private Sector to give feedback and pose challenging questions to teams. This weekend David Ostler, Chairman of unitedHealth posted feedback on our solution and several others. I thought I would repost the exchange here.
