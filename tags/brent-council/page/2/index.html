A seat has become vacant in the Stonebridge Ward following the death of Councillor Dorman Long. A by-election will be held on Thursday, 13 September 2007 to elect a new representative.
The by-election gives the Lib Dems another opportunity to win a seat - but will they win it? I doubt it. Stonebridge ward is a Labour heartland - you only have to look at the votes cast in the 2006 Local Election to see that… Winning this single seat will not change the overall political balance of Brent Council: The Lib Dems would need to win a few more by-elections or benefit from defections (not for the first time in Brent’s recent political history) in order to be in a position to leave the alliance with the Conservatives and lead a majority administration....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><span title="2007-08-09 08:57:31 +0000 UTC">August 9, 2007</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;1 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Rob Dyke</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label='post link to "Happy voting" ???' href=https://robdyke.com/h2r2d2/posts/2007/2007-08-09-happy-voting/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Electoral Canvassing 2007</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>The 2007 Electoral Canvass is about to start.

Shahrar told me about meeting Brent residents while campaigning during the local elections and a common gripe that came up - being issued with a ticket on a public holiday.
He writes:
“Trouble is, “Restrictions apply on Bank Holidays” signage is to be found only on some of the posts as one enters the zone. But most people, reasonably in my view, take their cue from the signage in the bays - which without any explicit indication to the contrary they will assume does not apply on public holidays.
Brent can’t have it both ways. Had the assumption not been justified there would hardly be a need for the additional signage. The trouble is these signs are not fit for purpose, ie. noticeable.
What’s at issue? Nobody likes to get a fine at the best of times, but the suspicion is that signage has been erected to maximise the chances of catching people out and making a quick buck. That’s dishonest and only fuels resentment towards local government - increasing cynicsm and eroding trust in public or democratic institutions, moreover.”
