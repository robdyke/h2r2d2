      <title>NHSHackday 3 - Video consultations for healthcare</title>

      <description>This weekend I was in Oxford for the first NHSHackday of 2013 where I worked on a video consultations project with some others from Tactix4 and Alacrity Foundation. I helped a few other with their hacking too, including @amcunningham and @simon_penny who created Muto network.
We thought that as online appointment booking and using video for clinical consultations are so QIPPing hot right now with the NHS Commissioning Board and the Department of Health Tech Office falling over themselves to encourage the use of Skype for Doctor/Patient consultations and being loudly evangelical about appointment booking we ought to hack something for that.</description>

      <description>In my job at Tactix4 I worked with others in the opensource and healthcare space to produce this briefing note for Cabinet Office on the use of hackdays to achieve a level playing field for Open Source in procurement and production.
This short note was produced in response to a request from Liam Maxwell made at EHI Live 2012 to investigate how hackdays could help procurement.

      <title>AsKiT collaboration comes second at Liverpool NHS Hackday</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the rest of Tactix4 I headed to Liverpool in September for the second NHS Hackday. We worked on a project called &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.nhshackday.com/wiki/AsKit&#34;&gt;AsKiT&lt;/a&gt; which came second. It was great to collaborate with others from NHS organisations to create problem solving code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The Problem: **All throughout the NHS there are a myriad of forms, questionnaires and assessments that need to be done, and the vast majority of them are done on paper, with the results stored in a folder in a cabinet or later scanned in and saved as a pdf file. Neither of these solutions allows ready access to the information in a digital form, and does not provide any of the benefits of digital capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; By creating a general-purpose question asking android app we have removed the need for the paper part of the process, now the questions are displayed on the screen and the results are captured digitally. It is no longer possible to write something that is illegible, or answers a numerical question with letters, or forget to answer certain questions. The results are then sent securely to the server where they are stored and can be forwarded directly to the appropriate system for further use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A few notes on the enthusiasm around healthcare IT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a renewed vigor in healthcare IT. Lots of great projects curated by enthusiastic people, encouraging new thinking around the definition, development design and delivery of technology for healthcare. Here I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://digihealthcon.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;DigiHealthCon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.handihealth.net/&#34;&gt;HANDI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://nhshackday.com/&#34;&gt;NHS Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ehealthopensource.org/&#34;&gt;eHealthOpenSource&lt;/a&gt; competition and Pipe and Hat Club. I&amp;rsquo;m involved in three organisations: eHealth OpenSource as Secretary, HANDI as a co-founder and NHS Hack Day as a participant and advocate. When I&amp;rsquo;m not doing things relating to those three, I&amp;rsquo;m a Director of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tactix4.com/&#34;&gt;Tactix4 Limited&lt;/a&gt;, an opensource healthcare IT company. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some of my thinking about these projects and how I see them fitting together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PatientList wins first NHS Hackday</title>
      <link>https://robdyke.com/h2r2d2/posts/2012/2012-06-05-patientlist-wins-first-nhs-hackday/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I participated in the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://nhshackday.com/&#34;&gt;NHS Hackday&lt;/a&gt; last month. The weekend event in central London brought together doctors, healthcare leaders and software developers with the aim of creating solutions to problems experienced on a daily basis in the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning development, called ‘Patient List’, aimed to improve the handover of patients and replace the traditional task-list methods usually employed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Patient List problem is felt by every junior doctor in the NHS, but it was formally raised by Wai Keong Wong in a blog post titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.openhealthcare.org.uk/?p=66&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Give every doctor an extra 30mins/day with patients&lt;/a&gt; by solving the &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nhshackday/8JAwPEQbJbk/discussion&#34;&gt;‘Patient List’ problem&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. In summary, a system is needed to save junior doctors from error-prone manual daily work compiling lists of patients and their treatments for their daily rounds. Furthermore, the system should include task lists for each patient and a way to manage transfer of tasks between shifts and departments so that nothing gets forgotten during handover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
