We worked on a project called AsKiT which came second. It was great to collaborate with others from NHS organisations to create problem solving code.
**The Problem: **All throughout the NHS there are a myriad of forms, questionnaires and assessments that need to be done, and the vast majority of them are done on paper, with the results stored in a folder in a cabinet or later scanned in and saved as a pdf file. Neither of these solutions allows ready access to the information in a digital form, and does not provide any of the benefits of digital capture.
The Solution: By creating a general-purpose question asking android app we have removed the need for the paper part of the process, now the questions are displayed on the screen and the results are captured digitally. It is no longer possible to write something that is illegible, or answers a numerical question with letters, or forget to answer certain questions. The results are then sent securely to the server where they are stored and can be forwarded directly to the appropriate system for further use.

Lots of great projects curated by enthusiastic people, encouraging new thinking around the definition, development design and delivery of technology for healthcare. Here I’m thinking about DigiHealthCon, HANDI, NHS Hack Day and the eHealthOpenSource competition and Pipe and Hat Club. I’m involved in three organisations: eHealth OpenSource as Secretary, HANDI as a co-founder and NHS Hack Day as a participant and advocate. When I’m not doing things relating to those three, I’m a Director of Tactix4 Limited, an opensource healthcare IT company.

The winning development, called ‘Patient List’, aimed to improve the handover of patients and replace the traditional task-list methods usually employed by doctors.
The Patient List problem is felt by every junior doctor in the NHS, but it was formally raised by Wai Keong Wong in a blog post titled “Give every doctor an extra 30mins/day with patients by solving the ‘Patient List’ problem”. In summary, a system is needed to save junior doctors from error-prone manual daily work compiling lists of patients and their treatments for their daily rounds. Furthermore, the system should include task lists for each patient and a way to manage transfer of tasks between shifts and departments so that nothing gets forgotten during handover.

With interests in open source, open standards and interoperability and with experience in and around the NHS, I’ve contributed to many solutions posted in the Healthcare challenge. I’ve commented on the interoperability challenges facing ‘Solutions’ such as ‘Give Patients Access to Data’ (a challenge involving Patient Opinion and MyDex, see previous post on Brent Council opening up resident data access) and on the use of social media in healthcare solutions … and the privacy implications there in….
I’ve been contributing heavily to a solution posted by Tim Knight which proposed greater use of open source practices in the NHS - provisionally titled Open Me Project (login req; email me for invitation).
The goal of the solution is to provide a framework and supporting tools for the collaborative development of open source solutions for NHS organisations and commercial healthcare providers. The solution has been voted up to progress from ‘Buzz’ stage to ‘Teaming’ stage.
As part of the incubation process for solutions, DotGovLabs have engaged the support of Experts from Departments of state and the Private Sector to give feedback and pose challenging questions to teams. This weekend David Ostler, Chairman of unitedHealth posted feedback on our solution and several others. I thought I would repost the exchange here.

Abstract: The dynamic between free-software and open-source is often misunderstood by social and political theorists. As a consequence it is also under-theorised within socio-political theory. In this paper, I show how philosophies of free/libre, open-source and commons regimes have engendered new forms of socio-political consumption and new political economies of meaning. My emphasis on the interplay between the local and the global/structure and agency, shows new ways of ‘thinking’ the cosmopolitan, sedimented in the interconnected networks of the technical age....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer><span title="2008-05-21 22:54:27 +0000 UTC">May 21, 2008</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;1 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Rob Dyke</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to dissertation project - submitted and now online" href=https://robdyke.com/h2r2d2/posts/2008/2008-05-21-dissertation-project-submitted-and-now-online/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>dissertation project - reviewed and replanned</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>I’ve been busy reviewing and replanning my dissertation project - only five weeks to go until hand-in!
