30,000 hours of open source hackery, 10,000 of them in health and care tech. I co-founded a [tech company](https://neovahealth.co.uk) that created [open eObs](https://openeobs.github.io/) and made [NHoS / NHSbuntu](https://nhos-project.github.io/) - an OS for the NHS. These days I research the security and privacy of apps listed in the [NHS Apps Library](https://robdyke.com/NHS-Apps-Library/).

I registered robdyke.com on the 19th August 2000. I started blogging in 2004. Amalgated here are the all the posts Iâ€™ve written since. Sorry for any dead links. There are many.
