Earlier this year I notified The Apperta Foundation - an NHS funded technology spin-out - that they had spilled usernames, passwords, and financial data on the internet. Apperta responded with legal action, reporting a cybercrime to the police, threatening a High Court injunction, and wrangling for months before finally accepting that I had deleted the materials I had discovered.

This is not, however, a post to recount subsequent events. I made [a site just for that](https://robdyke.com/howto-disclose/), and tweeted and posted updates to the [Go Fund Me](https://www.gofundme.com/f/responsible-rob) as things happened. Today I'm posting about just how punishing this has been for me, to my mental health, to my significant relationships.

When I first posted about what was happening I was inundated with positive messages. I felt strongly supported. This sustained me as I worked with my lawyers on a substantive reply to Apperta.

Two weeks later I announced that I had been contacted by the Police concerning a report of a cyber crime. Again my internet family, friends old and new, rallied around me. People I'd never met acted to defend me, independently verifing my claim, contacting the ICO, writing to the Police. There was a hiatus in the correspondence from Apperta's lawyers while the cyber complaint was considered.

Online I presented myself as confident, offline I grew increasingly anxious. The silent suspence was stressful. The releif I felt when the Police said that no action was warrented was short lived.

It was the threat of an Injuncion that really knocked me. I couldn't sleep. I ate too little. I lost weight. I took time off from work. What was initially a distraction had mushroomed. I felt consumed.

Costs ran to high. The generous support of friends old and new to the GFM covered two-thirds of these. I spent all the savings I had. I still owe a the lawyers several thousand.

Those around me were affected too, my family life suffered. The anxiety and stress of dealing with legal proceedings contributed to the breakup of my relationship.

Some blast radius.

Earlier this year I sent a security disclosure to Apperta, an NHS tech org, that had negligently spilled usernames, passwords, and financial data on the internet. Apperta responded with legal action, 

In March Apperta filed a cybercrime incident with the Police. Thankfully the report was closed, recorded as no action  necessary.

In the last week of April I received documents which showed that Apperta planned to file for an injunction at the High Court.

Over three months something in the region of 500 emails were exchanged in search of a form of words that Apperta would accept as confirmation that I had deleted the materials discovered.

Did I mention that El Reg covered this sorry state of affairs?

"NHS-backed org reacted to GitHub leak disclosure with legal threats and police call, complains IT pro.
Retention of now-deleted security breach evidence sparks spat"

A week ago I spoke to Paul Roberts of Security Ledger. His piece on this expensive, months-long legal tussle and recent calls for reform to our 30 year-old Computer Misuse Act, which criminalizes the work of ‘Good Samaritan’ security researchers acting in the public interest, is now online.

Today at NCSC #CYBERUK2021 event we heard that the Government is to reform Computer Misuse Act. Home secretary Priti Patel will explore reforming the Computer Misuse Act as calls mount for the 31-year-old law to be updated to reflect the changed online world.

"I believe now is the right time to undertake a formal review of the Computer Misuse Act. And today I am announcing that we will be launching a call for information on the Act this year." @pritipatel, Home Secretary #CYBERUK21

Awesome report by Secjuice founder @guisebule on the ongoing @AppertaUK #databreach scandal, their vindictive legal action against @robdykedotcom & the valiant efforts of the #infosec community to crowdfund Rob's legal costs and defend his responsible disclosure.

Its a beautiful day outside. I should be playing with Child v2. Instead I'm working on materials for the looming injunction that @AppertaUK seek against me.

Did you know that it costs iro £15k to defend an injunction? No, me neither. If I had known that at the start, I would have left the 'private and confidential business information' that @AppertaUK are so concerned about where I found it (open and public on Github)

Folks, just wanted to share with you the invoice for the work undertaken for the period 10th to 26th of March. That's £9500. Ouch.

Picture of invoice.

Some news! Earlier today I heard that there will be no action taken concerning the complaint made to the police. Phew, That's a weight off my mind.

In terms of costs, so far I've incurred around £10k including VAT. The other side have not accept any of the permutations offered by way of confirmatory statements. We continue to exchange letters...

I've written up much of the saga so far for your enjoyment. https://robdyke.com/howto-disclose/

Responsible Disclosure - Part 1 of ...?

TL;DR. I found secret info on GitHub, notified the owner, and found out the hard way that UK cyber law is broken.

24 days since I notified AppertaUK about the leaky repo, 23 days since they thanked me, & 18 days since I confirmed my clone was deleted (and have repeatedly confirmed to lawyer) this arrived.

Fun times.

Correspondence from other side late Friday and over the weekend. It appears they are determined to “shoot the messenger”, threatening and criticising me for flagging a problem to them.

This is not an attractive or reasonable approach.

I have already agreed, through lawyer, to give the undertakings set out in the substantive letter and have provided additional information and assurances to them

Today Legal team have written to the other side inviting them confirm that they will now withdraws its threat of civil proceedings against me and the serious allegation of committing a criminal offence.

Thank you. Each and every one of you. Legals covered. Crossed fingers. Remaining funds to @CodeYourFuture

Wowza. Thank you Twitter family for your support on this.

Just got off phone having instructed law firm to act for me. Holding letter being sent out to complainant today. Aiming to get a substantive response out to them on Friday. Probably about £3k+vat.

Humbled by generosity, strengthened by numbers.

Onwards!
